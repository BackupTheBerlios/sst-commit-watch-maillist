+This is the hackers' guide to SST2K.  Read it before messing with the code.
+
+It consists of an introduction, a history, suggestions for regression testing,
+some notes on the Python translation.  For a to-do list, see TODO in the
+top-level directory.
+
+INTRODUCTION:
+
+SST2K is a Python translation of a C translation of a FORTRAN
+original dating back to 1973.  Beautiful Python it is not, but it
+works. 
+
+The intention of SST2K is to be able to replicate precisely the 
+experience of the original game, while allowing new features to be
+added under option control.  Therefore, be very conservative about
+what changes are visible under the 'plain' option.
+
+HISTORY:
+
+Dave Matuszek, one of the two original authors, says:
+
+SRSCAN, MOVE, PHASERS, CALL, STATUS, IMPULSE, PHOTONS, ABANDON,
+LRSCAN, WARP, SHIELDS, DESTRUCT, CHART, REST, DOCK, QUIT, and DAMAGE
+were in the original non-&quot;super&quot; version of UT FORTRAN Star Trek.
+
+Tholians were not in the original. Dave is dubious about their merits.
+(They are now controlled by OPTION_THOLIAN and turned off if the game
+type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+Planets and dilithium crystals were not in the original.  Dave is OK
+with this idea. (It's now controlled by OPTION_PLANETS and turned 
+off if the game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+Dave says the bit about the Galileo getting turned into a
+McDonald's is &quot;consistant with our original vision&quot;.  (This has been
+left permanently enabled, as it can only happen if OPTION_PLANETS
+is on.)
+
+Dave also says the Space Thingy should not be preserved across saved
+games, so you can't prove to others that you've seen it.  He says it
+shouldn't fire back, either.  It should do nothing except scream and
+disappear when hit by photon torpedos.  It's OK that it may move
+when attacked, but it didn't in the original.  (Whether the Thingy
+can fire back is now controlled by OPTION_THINGY and turned off if the
+game type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.  The no-save behavior has been restored.)
+
+The Faerie Queen, black holes, and time warping were in the original.
+
+Here are Tom Almy's changes:
+
+In early 1997, I got the bright idea to look for references to
+&quot;Super Star Trek&quot; on the World Wide Web. There weren't many hits,
+but there was one that came up with 1979 Fortran sources! This
+version had a few additional features that mine didn't have,
+however mine had some feature it didn't have. So I merged its
+features that I liked. I also took a peek at the DECUS version (a
+port, less sources, to the PDP-10), and some other variations.
+
+1, Compared to the original UT version, I've changed the &quot;help&quot;
+command to &quot;call&quot; and the &quot;terminate&quot; command to &quot;quit&quot; to better
+match user expectations. The DECUS version apparently made those
+changes as well as changing &quot;freeze&quot; to &quot;save&quot;. However I like
+&quot;freeze&quot;.  (Both &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;save&quot; work in SST2K.)
+
+2. The experimental deathray originally had only a 5% chance of
+success, but could be used repeatedly. I guess after a couple
+years of use, it was less &quot;experimental&quot; because the 1979
+version had a 70% success rate. However it was prone to breaking
+after use. I upgraded the deathray, but kept the original set of
+failure modes (great humor!).  (Now controlled by OPTION_DEATHRAY
+and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+3. The 1979 version also mentions srscan and lrscan working when
+docked (using the starbase's scanners), so I made some changes here
+to do this (and indicating that fact to the player), and then realized
+the base would have a subspace radio as well -- doing a Chart when docked
+updates the star chart, and all radio reports will be heard. The Dock
+command will also give a report if a base is under attack.
+
+4. Tholian Web from the 1979 version.  (Now controlled by
+OPTION_THOLIAN and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+5. Enemies can ram the Enterprise. (Now controlled by OPTION_RAMMING
+and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+6. Regular Klingons and Romulans can move in Expert and Emeritus games. 
+This code could use improvement. (Now controlled by OPTION_MVBADDY
+and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
+
+7. The deep-space probe feature from the DECUS version.  (Now controlled
+by OPTION_PROBE and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;).
+
+8. 'emexit' command from the 1979 version.
+
+9. Bugfix: Klingon commander movements are no longer reported if long-range 
+sensors are damaged.
+
+10. Bugfix: Better base positioning at startup (more spread out).
+That made sense to add because most people abort games with 
+bad base placement.
+
+In June 2002, I fixed two known bugs and a documentation typo.
+In June 2004 I fixed a number of bugs involving: 1) parsing invalid
+numbers, 2) manual phasers when SR scan is damaged and commander is
+present, 3) time warping into the future, 4) hang when moving
+klingons in crowded quadrants.  (These fixes are in SST2K.)
+
+Here are Stas Sergeev's changes:
+
+1. The Space Thingy can be shoved, if you ram it, and can fire back if 
+fired upon. (Now controlled by OPTION_THINGY and turned off if game 
+type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
+
+2. When you are docked, base covers you with an almost invincible shield. 
+(A commander can still ram you, or a Romulan can destroy the base,
+or a SCom can even succeed with direct attack IIRC, but this rarely 
+happens.)  (Now controlled by OPTION_BASE and turned off if game 
+type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
+
+3. Ramming a black hole is no longer instant death.  There is a
+chance you might get timewarped instead. (Now controlled by 
+OPTION_BLKHOLE and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
+
+4. The Tholian can be hit with phasers.
+
+5. SCom can't escape from you if no more enemies remain 
+(without this, chasing SCom can take an eternity).
+
+6. Probe target you enter is now the destination quadrant. Before I don't 
+remember what it was, but it was something I had difficulty using.
+
+7. Secret password is now autogenerated.
+
+8. &quot;Plaque&quot; is adjusted for A4 paper :-)
+
+9. Phasers now tells you how much energy needed, but only if the computer 
+is alive.
+
+10. Planets are auto-scanned when you enter the quadrant.
+
+11. Mining or using crystals in presense of enemy now yields an attack.
+There are other minor adjustments to what yields an attack
+and what does not.
+
+12. &quot;freeze&quot; command reverts to &quot;save&quot;, most people will understand this
+better anyway. (SST2K recognizes both.)
+
+13. Screen-oriented interface, with sensor scans always up.  (SST2K
+supports both screen-oriented and TTY modes.)
+
+Eric Raymond's changes:
+
+Mainly, I translated this C code out of FORTRAN into C -- created #defines
+for a lot of magic numbers and refactored the heck out of it.
+
+1. &quot;sos&quot; and &quot;call&quot; becomes &quot;mayday&quot;, &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;save&quot; are both good.
+
+2. Status report now indicates when dilithium crystals are on board.
+
+3. Per Dave Matuszek's remarks, Thingy state is never saved across games.
+
+4. Added game option selection so you can play a close (but not bug-for-
+bug identical) approximation of older versions.
+
+5. Half the quadrants now have inhabited planets, from which one 
+cannot mine dilithium (there will still be the same additional number
+of dilithium-bearing planets).  Torpedoing an inhabited world is *bad*.
+There is BSD-Trek-like logic for Klingons to attack and enslave 
+inhabited worlds, producing more ships (only is skill is 'good' or 
+better). (Controlled by OPTION_WORLDS and turned off if game 
+type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
+
+6. User input is now logged so we can do regression testing.
+
+7. More BSD-Trek features: You can now lose if your entire crew
+dies in battle.  When abandoning ship in a game with inhabited
+worlds enabled, they must have one in the quadrant to beam down
+to; otherwise they die in space and this counts heavily against
+your score.  Docking at a starbase replenishes your crew.
+
+8. Still more BSD-Trek: we now have a weighted damage table.
+Also, the nav subsystem (enabling automatic course
+setting) can be damaged separately from the main computer (which
+handles weapons targeting, ETA calculation, and self-destruct).
+
+After these features were added, I translated this into Python and added
+more:
+
+9. A long-range scan is done silently whenever you call CHART; thus
+the LRSCAN command is no longer needed.  (Controlled by OPTION_AUTOSCAN
+and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
+
+TESTING:
+
+This code has been designed to be tested.  A simple shellscript
+included in the distribution, 'replay', automatically reruns the
+last game you played.
+
+Here are some interesting seeds for debugging and regression testing
+For each one, I list the seed, the options, and the last svn revision
+for which it is known to have given the described behavior.
+
+1160647745 regular short good fancy	(r769)
+
+Starts you in a quadrant with the Super-Commander in it.  Slamming three
+torps at him will kill him.  You can use this to regression-test both
+torpedo tracks and the Deep Space Probe. Known bug: &quot;probe aut 2 8&quot;
+triggers manual navigation.
+
+1160707235 regular short good fancy	(r769)
+
+Do sr/mov aut 5 4/sr/sensors/orbit/transport; you'll get a transporter
+failure.
+
+NOTES ON THE PYTHON TRANSLATION:
+
+The Python translation was done with a regexp-based C-to-Python
+translator I wrote for the purpose (I expect to release this as a
+separate project).  I then hand-tuned and refactored the result.
+
+The LOC count dropped by almost exactly 20% during this process, from
+a bit over 8100 lines to a bit over 6500 lines.  If the code is still
+shorter than that when you read thism, it's because this file comtains
+nost of what used to be a huge header comment.  
+
+SST is not a data-structure- intensive program, so it compresses less
+under translation to Python than the 50% drop in LOC I've found to be
+more typical.  The gain in readability, though impossible to quantify,
+is much greater than the drop in line count would suggest.
+
+Some parts of the code, such as the finish() and score() functions, 
+have barely been touched.  Code in the general category of report 
+generators has tended to change little, especially since we've tried
+to preserve the look and feel of the original.
+
+On the other hand, the vector-arithmetic code around navigation and
+torpedos, and deep-space-probe handling changed a lot.  All that 
+stuff is now centralized in a 'course' object that hides the
+trigonometric calculations.  
+
+The course object builds on a 'coord' object, which I actually had
+introduced while refactoring the C version.  Large parts of SST2K are,
+perforce, an exercise in 2D vector arithmetic.  In the original
+FORTRAN all the vector representation was done with parallel arrays;
+in C, I introduced a struct; in Python, the class has a complete
+repertoire of vector-algebra operations.

-for a lot of magic numbers and refactored the heck out of it.
-
-1. &quot;sos&quot; and &quot;call&quot; becomes &quot;mayday&quot;, &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;save&quot; are both good.
-
-2. Status report now indicates when dilithium crystals are on board.
-
-3. Per Dave Matuszek's remarks, Thingy state is never saved across games.
-
-4. Added game option selection so you can play a close (but not bug-for-
-bug identical) approximation of older versions.
-
-5. Half the quadrants now have inhabited planets, from which one 
-cannot mine dilithium (there will still be the same additional number
-of dilithium-bearing planets).  Torpedoing an inhabited world is *bad*.
-There is BSD-Trek-like logic for Klingons to attack and enslave 
-inhabited worlds, producing more ships (only is skill is 'good' or 
-better). (Controlled by OPTION_WORLDS and turned off if game 
-type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
-
-6. User input is now logged so we can do regression testing.
-
-7. More BSD-Trek features: You can now lose if your entire crew
-dies in battle.  When abandoning ship in a game with inhabited
-worlds enabled, they must have one in the quadrant to beam down
-to; otherwise they die in space and this counts heavily against
-your score.  Docking at a starbase replenishes your crew.
-
-8. Still more BSD-Trek: we now have a weighted damage table.
-Also, the nav subsystem (enabling automatic course
-setting) can be damaged separately from the main computer (which
-handles weapons targeting, ETA calculation, and self-destruct).
-
-After these features were added, I translated this into Python and added
-more:
-
-9. A long-range scan is done silently whenever you call CHART; thus
-the LRSCAN command is no longer needed.  (Controlled by OPTION_AUTOSCAN
-and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;almy&quot;.)
