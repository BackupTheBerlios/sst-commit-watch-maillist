 Here are Tom Almy's changes:
 
-   Compared to original version, I've changed the &quot;help&quot; command to
-   &quot;call&quot; and the &quot;terminate&quot; command to &quot;quit&quot; to better match
-   user expectations. The DECUS version apparently made those changes
-   as well as changing &quot;freeze&quot; to &quot;save&quot;. However I like &quot;freeze&quot;.
-   (Both &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;save&quot; work in SST2K.)
+   In early 1997, I got the bright idea to look for references to
+   &quot;Super Star Trek&quot; on the World Wide Web. There weren't many hits,
+   but there was one that came up with 1979 Fortran sources! This
+   version had a few additional features that mine didn't have,
+   however mine had some feature it didn't have. So I merged its
+   features that I liked. I also took a peek at the DECUS version (a
+   port, less sources, to the PDP-10), and some other variations.
 
-   When I got a later version of Super Star Trek that I was converting
-   from, I added the emexit command.
+   1, Compared to the original UT version, I've changed the &quot;help&quot; command to
+      &quot;call&quot; and the &quot;terminate&quot; command to &quot;quit&quot; to better match
+      user expectations. The DECUS version apparently made those changes
+      as well as changing &quot;freeze&quot; to &quot;save&quot;. However I like &quot;freeze&quot;.
+      (Both &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;save&quot; work in SST2K.)
 
-   That later version also mentions srscan and lrscan working when
-   docked (using the starbase's scanners), so I made some changes here
-   to do this (and indicating that fact to the player), and then realized
-   the base would have a subspace radio as well -- doing a Chart when docked
-   updates the star chart, and all radio reports will be heard. The Dock
-   command will also give a report if a base is under attack.
+   2. The experimental deathray originally had only a 5% chance of
+      success, but could be used repeatedly. I guess after a couple
+      years of use, it was less &quot;experimental&quot; because the 1979
+      version had a 70% success rate. However it was prone to breaking
+      after use. I upgraded the deathray, but kept the original set of
+      failure modes (great humor!).  (Now controlled by OPTION_DEATHRAY
+      and turned off if game type is &quot;plain&quot;.)
 
-   Klingon commander movements are no longer reported if long-range 
-   sensors are damaged.
+   3. The 1979 version also mentions srscan and lrscan working when
