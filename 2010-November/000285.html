-Tom Almy story:
-
-Back in (about) 1977 I got a copy of this Super Star Trek game for
-the CDC 6600 mainframe computer. Someone had converted it to PDP-11
-Fortran but couldn't get it to run because of its size. I modified
-the program to use overlays and managed to shoehorn it in on the 56k
-byte machine.
-
-I liked the game so much I put some time into fixing bugs, mainly
-what could be called continuity errors and loopholes in the game's
-logic. We even played a couple tournaments.
-
-In 1979, I lost access to that PDP-11. I did save the source code
-listing. In 1995, missing that old friend, I started converting the
-program into portable ANSI C. It's been slow, tedious work that took
-over a year to accomplish.
-
-In early 1997, I got the bright idea to look for references to &quot;Super
-Star Trek&quot; on the World Wide Web. There weren't many hits, but there
-was one that came up with 1979 Fortran sources! This version had a
-few additional features that mine didn't have, however mine had some
-feature it didn't have. So I merged its features that I liked. I also
-took a peek at the DECUS version (a port, less sources, to the
-PDP-10), and some other variations.
-
-Modifications I made:
-
-  Compared to original version, I've changed the &quot;help&quot; command to
-  &quot;call&quot; and the &quot;terminate&quot; command to &quot;quit&quot; to better match user
-  expectations. The DECUS version apparently made those changes as well
-  as changing &quot;freeze&quot; to &quot;save&quot;. However I like &quot;freeze&quot;.
-
-  I added EMEXIT from the 1979 version.
-
-  That later version also mentions srscan and lrscan working when
-  docked (using the starbase's scanners), so I made some changes here
-  to do this (and indicating that fact to the player), and then
-  realized the base would have a subspace radio as well -- doing a
-  Chart when docked updates the star chart, and all radio reports will
-  be heard. The Dock command will also give a report if a base is under
-  attack.
-
-  It also had some added logic to spread the initial positioning of
-  bases. That made sense to add because most people abort games with
-  bad base placement.
-
-  The experimental deathray originally had only a 5% chance of success,
-  but could be used repeatedly. I guess after a couple years of use, it
-  was less &quot;experimental&quot; because the 1979 version had a 70% success
-  rate. However it was prone to breaking after use. I upgraded the
-  deathray, but kept the original set of failure modes (great humor!).
-
-  I put in the Tholian Web code from the 1979 version.
-
-  I added code so that Romulans and regular Klingons could move in
-  advanced games. I re-enabled the code which allows enemy ships to
-  ram the Enterprise; it had never worked right. The 1979 version
-  seems to have it all fixed up, but I'm still not overly happy with
-  the algorithm.
-
-  The DECUS version had a Deep Space Probe. Looked like a good idea
-  so I implimented it based on its description.

-Stas Sergeev story:
-
-Found Tom Almy's C sources - yeah! Hmm, not too playable - I've got
-used to that nice text-based GUI I've seen on an IBM S/370 port, and the
-command-line control gets me quite annoyed. But that's a good starting
-point for some improvements - the sources are finally here! I was about
-to start writing an S/370 emulator to get it a go, and now here are
-the sources - what a great finding.
-
-[a bit later]
-
-Added a text-based interface which makes the game much more playable.
-Initially I made it for DOS using conio.h. Later I decided to make a
-linux port, and I ported it using a linux-conio package. I had to patch
-linux-conio a lot, so you have to use my version. The colors are still
-wrong though.
-I also fixed an uncountable amount of bugs and added some features, I
-can't remember now which ones.
-
-[3 years later]
-
-I dusted off the game and finally got around to move it to autoconf.
-For building with Borland C under DOS, use the build_bc.bat file.
-
-It turned out Tom Almy also did a linux port and made some bug-fixing
-work, although to the much smaller extent than I did. I contacted him
-and notified about my port, but he expressed no interest. :(
-
-[a year later]
-
-I've found out that Eric S Raymond (ESR) took over the development
-of the Tom Almy's sources. He could use mine instead as they are
-much more advanced, but oh well... Now I have to find out the way
-to incorporate my mods into his version and hope that he can do
-the better work on that game than I could (which is most likely
-the case).
-.....
-OK, the changes were incorporated, however Eric removed the conio
-port and therefore the game can no longer be compiled with bcc/DOS.
-The DJGPP port might still be possible in the future.
